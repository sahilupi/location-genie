        A. <i>Information that you provide</i> We receive, store, and process
        information, including Personal Information, which you provide when

        general information (e.g. IP address, zip code) and more specific
        information (e.g. GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to

        Site through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide
        us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other
        location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows

        We may also receive, store and process Log Data, which is information
        that is automatically recorded by our servers whenever you access or use
        the Site, regardless of whether you are registered with Location Genie
        or logged in to your Location Genie Account, such as your IP Address,
        the date and time you access or use the Site, the hardware and software
        you are using, referring and exit pages and URLs, the number of clicks,
        device event information, pages viewed and the order of those pages, and
        the amount of time spent on particular pages.

        <li>Cookies and other Tracking Technologies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Location Genie uses cookies and other similar technologies, such as
        mobile application and other device identifiers, on the Site. We may
        also allow our business partners to use their cookies and other tracking
        technologies on the Site. As a result, when you access or use the Site,
        you will provide or make available certain information to us and to our
        business partners.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser
        settings, we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track”
        signal in the HTTP header from your browser. We track your activities if
        you click on advertisements for Location Genie services on Third-Party
        sites such as search engines and social networks, and may use analytics
        to track what you do in response to those advertisements.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may, either directly or through Third Parties we engage to provide
        services to us, also continue to track your behavior on our own Site for
        purposes of our own customer support, analytics, research, product
        development, fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance,
        investigation, as well as to enable you to use and access the Site and
        pay for your activities on the Site. We may also, either directly or
        through Third Parties we engage to provide services to us, track your
        behavior on our own Site to market and advertise our services to you on
        the Site and Third-Party websites. Third Parties that use cookies and
        other tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements on our
        Site and/or Third-Party websites may offer you a way to prevent such
        targeted advertisements by opting-out at the websites of industry groups
        such as the

        >
        Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted
        advertising, you may still receive advertising on or about the Site – it
        just will not be tailored to your interests. In addition, if you disable
        cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of using
        our Site and Services, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance
        your use and access.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third Parties may not collect information about users’ online activities
        on the Site except as described in this policy.

        <li>Third-Party social plugins</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our Site may use social plugins, which are provided and operated by
        Third Parties (e.g. Facebook’s Like Button).
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result of this, you may send to the Third Party the information
        that you are viewing on a certain part of our Site. If you are not
        logged into your account with the Third Party, then the Third Party may
        not know your identity. If you are logged into your account with the
        Third Party, then the Third Party may be able to link information about
        your visit to our Site to your account with them. Similarly, the Third
        Party may record your interactions with the social plugin.

          general purposes:</i
        >
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>to enable you to access and use the Site;</li>
        <li>
          to enable you to communicate with other Members, including but not
          limited to by sending them messages or other information during the
          booking process;
        </li>
        <li>
          to operate, protect, improve and optimize the Site, Location Genie’s
          business, and our users’ experience, such as to perform analytics,
          conduct research, personalize or otherwise customize your experience,
          and to provide customer service;
        </li>
        <li>
          to help create and maintain a trusted and safer environment on the
          Site and Services, such as detection and prevention of actual and
          potential fraud and other harmful activity, conducting investigations
          and risk assessments, enforcing our Terms and policies, verifying the
          address of your listings, verifying any identifications provided by
          you (including by comparing the photo on that identification to
          another photo you provide to us), and conducting checks against
          databases and information sources (such as but not limited to public
          government databases) for fraud detection and prevention, risk
          assessment and harm prevention purposes. In this regard, we may do any
          or all of the foregoing with or without further notifying you;
        </li>
        <li>
          to send you service, support and administrative messages, reminders,
          technical notices, updates, security alerts, and information requested
          by you;
        </li>

          to send you marketing, advertising, and promotional messages and other
          information that may be of interest to you, including information

          these communications in your settings when you login to your Location
          Genie Account or by sending us a message from Contact section on the
          Site;
        </li>
        <li>
          to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes that we may
          have with any of our users, and enforce our agreements with Third
          Parties.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>B. How Location Genie Uses and Processes User Communications</i></p>
      <p>
        We may, either directly or through Third Parties we engage to provide
        services to us, review, scan, or analyze your communications with other
        users exchanged via the Site for fraud prevention, risk assessment,
        regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research and
        customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention
        efforts, the Site may scan and analyze messages to help prevent Renters
        from substantially misleading Listers about the scope of their project,
        or fraudulent Listers asking to be paid outside of the Site. We may also
        scan, review or analyze messages for research and product development
        purposes to help make search, booking and user communications more
        efficient and effective, as well as to debug, improve and expand product
        offerings. We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications for
        sending Third-Party marketing messages to you. We will also not sell
        these reviews or analyses of communications to Third Parties. We will
        also use automated methods to carry out these reviews or analyses where
        reasonably possible. However, from time to time we may have to manually
        review some communications. By using the Site, you consent that Location
        Genie, in its sole discretion, may, either directly or through Third
        Parties we engage to provide services to us, review, scan, analyze, and
        store your communications, whether done manually or through automated
        means.
      </p>
      <h2>6. Disclosing Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may transfer, store, use and process your information, including any
        Personal Information, to/in countries outside of the European Economic
        Area (“EEA”) and/or United States. Please note that laws vary from
        jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and so the privacy laws applicable to the
        places where your information is transferred to or stored, used or
        processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the
        place where you are resident.
      </p>
      <p>Your Personal Information may be disclosed as follows:&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          i. Parts of your public profile page that contain some Personal
          Information may be displayed in other parts of the Site to other users
          for marketing purposes or if you post content in a community forum or
          other features on the Site that are visible to the general public.
        </li>
        <li>
          ii. Your public listing page will always include some minimum
          information such as the city and area where the Property is located,
          your listing description, your calendar availability, your public
          profile photo, and any additional information you share with other
          Members. Parts of your public listing page may be displayed in other
          parts of the Site to other Members and/or Third-Party sites for
          marketing purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          iii. The Site allows your public profile and public listing pages to
          be included in search engines, in which case your public profile and
          public listing pages will be indexed by search engines and may be
          published as search results.
        </li>
        <li>
          iv. When you submit a request to book a Property, your full name, and
          the full name of any confirmed Renter in your Booking, and other
          Personal Information you agree to pass through to the Lister(s) will
          become visible to the Lister(s) of any Property you book or request to
          book. We may also disclose parts of your public profile, other Member
          reviews of you, and any additional information you share with other
          Members. In addition, if you agree to be contacted by the Lister(s) by
          phone before your request to book is accepted, and the Lister(s)
          decide(s) to do so, Location Genie will call your phone number first,
          before connecting you with the Lister(s). We will not share your phone
          number unless there is a confirmed booking; if there is a confirmed
          booking, your phone number will become visible to the Renter, who may
          call you directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          v. When your request to book a Property is accepted by the Lister(s)
          or when a Renter books your Property, we will disclose some of your
          Personal Information to the Lister(s) and any confirmed Renter(s).
          However, your billing and payout information will never be shared with
          another user.
        </li>
        <li>
          vi. When a Lister accepts your request to book a Property, the Lister
          may elect to use Third-Party Services available through the Location
          Genie Site to assist with managing the Property on and before the
          shoot dates, such as shoot supervision and coordination, and key
          providers. The Lister may use features on the Location Genie Site to
          share information about the Renter with that Third-Party Service
          provider for the purposes of coordinating the shoot or managing the
          Property, including check-in and check-out dates or hours, rental
          agreements, rules, and terms, Renter name, Renter's phone number, and
          the Renter's anonymized email address.
        </li>
        <li>
          vii. When a Renter books your Property or when you book a Lister's
          Property, we may ask you to review the Lister, Renter, or the
          Property. If you choose to provide a review, your review may be public
          on the Site. Likewise, another Member’s review of you may be public on
          the Site.
        </li>
        <li>
          viii. You may link your account on a Third-Party social networking
          site to your Location Genie Account. We refer to a person’s contacts
          on these Third-Party sites as “Friends”. When you create this
          linkage:&nbsp;
          <ul>
            <li>
              some of the information you provide to us from the linking of your
              accounts may be published on your Location Genie profile;
            </li>
            <li>
              your activities on the Site may be displayed to your Friends on
              the Site and/or that Third-Party site;
            </li>
            <li>
              a link to your public profile on that Third-Party social
              networking site may be included in your Location Genie public
              profile;
            </li>
            <li>
