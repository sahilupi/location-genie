      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>
        PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT
        INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND OBLIGATIONS. THESE
        INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, A CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS THE
        JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF DISPUTES, AND OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH
        APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      </p>
      <p>
        IN PARTICULAR, LISTERS SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW THE LAWS WORK IN THEIR
        RESPECTIVE CITIES. SOME CITIES HAVE LAWS THAT RESTRICT THEIR ABILITY TO
        LISTER PAYING RENTERS FOR SHORT-TERM RENTALS. IN MANY CITIES, LISTERS
        MUST REGISTER, GET A PERMIT, OR OBTAIN A LICENSE BEFORE LISTING A
        PROPERTY OR ACCEPTING RENTERS. CERTAIN TYPES OF SHORT-TERM BOOKINGS MAY
        BE PROHIBITED ALTOGETHER. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VARY GREATLY IN HOW THEY
        ENFORCE THESE LAWS. PENALTIES MAY INCLUDE FINES OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT.
        LISTERS SHOULD REVIEW LOCAL LAWS BEFORE LISTING A SPACE ON LOCATION
        GENIE.

        By using the Site or Services, you agree to comply with and be legally
        bound by the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service ("Terms"),
        whether or not you become a registered user of the Services. These Terms

        certain aspects of the Services or Collective Content) may have
        different terms and conditions, standards, guidelines, or policies

        conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and
        conditions posted for a specific area of the Site, Services, or

      </p>
      <p>
        THE SITE AND SERVICES COMPRISE AN ONLINE PLATFORM THROUGH WHICH LISTERS
        MAY CREATE LISTINGS FOR PROPERTIES AND RENTERS MAY LEARN ABOUT AND BOOK
        PROPERTIES DIRECTLY WITH THE LISTERS. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT
        LOCATION GENIE IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN
        LISTERS AND RENTERS, NOR IS LOCATION GENIE A REAL ESTATE BROKER, AGENT
        OR INSURER. LOCATION GENIE HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE CONDUCT OF LISTERS,
        RENTERS AND OTHER USERS OF THE SITE AND SERVICES OR ANY PROPERTIES, AND
        DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY IN THIS REGARD TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED
        BY LAW.
      </p>
      <p>
        IF YOU CHOOSE TO CREATE A LISTING ON LOCATION GENIE, YOU UNDERSTAND AND
        AGREE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCATION GENIE IS LIMITED TO BEING A
        MEMBER AND AN INDEPENDENT, THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTOR, AND NOT AN EMPLOYEE,
        AGENT, JOINT VENTURER OR PARTNER OF LOCATION GENIE FOR ANY REASON, AND
        YOU ACT EXCLUSIVELY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF AND FOR YOUR OWN BENEFIT, AND NOT
        ON BEHALF OF OR FOR THE BENEFIT OF LOCATION GENIE. LOCATION GENIE DOES
        NOT CONTROL, AND HAS NO RIGHT TO CONTROL, YOUR LISTING, YOUR OFFLINE
        ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR LISTING, OR ANY OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO

        INAPPROPRIATELY USING ANY LOCATION GENIE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
      </p>
      <p>
        YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE OR
        SERVICES OR BY DOWNLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM OR ON THE SITE OR
        THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, AND THAT
        YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND RECEIVE OUR

        NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE

        entity to these Terms and, in such event, "you" and "your" will refer
        and apply to that company or other legal entity.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Modification</h2>
      <p>
        Location Genie reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify the
        Site or Services or to modify these Terms, including the Service Fees,
        at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will
        either post the modification on the Site or otherwise provide you with
        notice of the modification. We will also update the "Last Updated" date
        at the top of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Site or
        Services after we have posted a modification on the Site or have
        provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you
        agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not
        acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site and
        Services.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        The Site and Services are intended solely for persons who are 18 or
        older. Any access to or use of the Site or Services by anyone under 18
        is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Site or Services you
        represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.
      </p>
      <p>
        For users in the United States, Location Genie may, to the extent
        permitted by applicable laws and if we have sufficient information to
        identify a user, obtain reports from public records of criminal
        convictions or sex offender registrations of the user. For users outside
        the United States, we may, to the extent permitted by applicable laws
        and if we have sufficient information to identify a user, obtain the
        local version of background or registered sex offender checks in our
        sole discretion. You agree and authorize us to use your personal
        information, such as your full name and date of birth, to obtain such
        reports, including from Location Genie's vendors.
      </p>
      <h2>5. How the Site and Services Work</h2>
      <p>
        The Site and Services can be used to facilitate the listing and booking
        of Properties. Such Properties are included in Listings on the Site and
        Services by Listers. You may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to
        the Site and Services; however, if you wish to book a Property or create
        a Listing, you must first register to create a Location Genie Account
        (defined below).
      </p>
      <p>
        As stated above, Location Genie makes available an online platform or
        marketplace with related technology for Renters and Listers to meet
        online and arrange for bookings of Properties directly with each other.
        Location Genie is not an owner or operator of properties, nor is it a
        provider of properties, and Location Genie does not own, sell, resell,
        furnish, provide, rent, re-rent, manage and/or control properties.
        Unless explicitly specified otherwise in the Location Genie platform,
        Location Genie's responsibilities are limited to facilitating the
        availability of the Site and Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO
        BE USED TO FACILITATE LISTERS AND RENTERS CONNECTING AND BOOKING
        PROPERTIES DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. LOCATION GENIE CANNOT AND DOES NOT
        CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND THE CONDITION,
        LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY PROPERTIES. LOCATION GENIE IS NOT
        RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND
        ALL LISTINGS AND PROPERTIES. ACCORDINGLY, ANY BOOKINGS WILL BE MADE OR
        ACCEPTED AT THE MEMBER'S OWN RISK.
      </p>
      <h2>6. Account Registration</h2>
      <p>
        In order to access certain features of the Site and to book a Property
        or create a Listing, you must register to create an account ("Location
        Genie Account") and become a Member. You may register to join the
        Services directly via the Site or as described in this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also register to join by logging into your account with certain
        third-party social networking sites ("SNS") (including, but not limited
        to, Facebook; each such account, a "Third-Party Account"), via our Site,
        as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site and
        Services, you may link your Location Genie Account with Third-Party
        Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third-Party Account login
        information to Location Genie through the Site or Services; or (ii)
        allowing Location Genie to access your Third-Party Account, as permitted
        under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each
        Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose
        your Third-Party Account login information to Location Genie and/or
        grant Location Genie access to your Third-Party Account (including, but
        not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without
        breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of
        the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Location Genie
        to pay any fees or making Location Genie subject to any usage
        limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting
        Location Genie access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that
        Location Genie will access, make available and store (if applicable) any
        Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account
        ("SNS Content") so that it is available on and through the Site and
        Services via your Location Genie Account and Location Genie Account
        profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS
        Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all
        purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you
        choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such
        Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post
        to your Third-Party Accounts will be available on and through your
        Location Genie Account on the Site and Services. Please note that if a
        Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or
        Location Genie's access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the
        third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be
        available on and through the Site and Services. You have the ability to
        disable the connection between your Location Genie Account and your
        Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the "Settings" section
        of the Site and Application. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
        THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS
        IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE
        PROVIDERS. Location Genie makes no effort to review any SNS Content for
        any purpose, including but not limited to for accuracy, legality or
        non-infringement and Location Genie is not responsible for any SNS
        Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your Location Genie Account and your Location Genie Account profile page
        will be created for your use of the Site based upon the personal
        information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described
        above. You may not have more than one (1) active Location Genie Account.
        You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during
        the registration process and to update such information to keep it
        accurate, current and complete. Location Genie reserves the right to
        suspend or terminate your Location Genie Account and your access to the
        Site and Services if you create more than one (1) Location Genie
        Account, or if any information provided during the registration process
        or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, not current,
        incomplete, or otherwise in violation of these Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you
        will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will
        take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your
        Location Genie Account, whether or not you have authorized such
        activities or actions. You will immediately notify Location Genie of any
        unauthorized use of your Location Genie Account.
      </p>
      <h2>7. Property Listings</h2>
      <p>
        As a Member, you may create Listings. To create a Listing, you will be
        asked a variety of questions about the Property to be listed, including,
        but not limited to, the property, capacity, size, features, and
        availability of the Property and pricing and related rules and financial
        terms. In order to be featured in Listings via the Site and Services,
        all Properties must have valid physical addresses. Listings will be made
        publicly available via the Site and Services. You understand and agree
        that the placement or ranking of Listings in search results may depend
        on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, Renter and
        Lister preferences, ratings and/or ease of booking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other Members will be able to book your Property via the Site and
        Services based upon the information provided in your Listing, your
        Renter requirements, and Renters' search parameters and preferences. You
        understand and agree that once a Renter requests a booking of your
        Property, you may not request the Renter to pay a higher price than in
        the booking request.
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for any and all
        Listings and Member Content you post. Accordingly, you represent and
        warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Renter's stay
        at, a Property in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements
        you have entered into with any third parties, such as property owners
        association, condominium, lease or rental agreements, and (ii) will (a)
        be in compliance with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws and laws
        governing rentals of residential and other properties), Tax
        requirements, Intellectual Property laws, and rules and regulations that
        may apply to any Property included in a Listing you post (including
        having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not
        conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Location
        Genie assumes no responsibility for a Lister's compliance with any
        agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and
        regulations. Location Genie reserves the right, at any time and without
        prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason,
        including Listings that Location Genie, in its sole discretion,
        considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these
        Terms, or otherwise harmful to the Site or Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a Lister, you understand and agree that Location Genie does
        not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Renter requests
        a booking of your Property and stays at your Property, any agreement you
        enter into with such Renter is between you and the Renter and Location
        Genie is not a party to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a Lister, Location Genie makes certain tools available to you
        to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to
        confirm or preapprove for booking for your Property. You acknowledge and
        agree that, as a Lister, you are responsible for your own acts and
        omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any
        individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Property at
        your request or invitation, excluding the Renter (and the individuals
        the Renter invites to the Property, if applicable.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Location Genie may offer Listers the option of having photographers take
        photographs of their Properties. If you as a Lister choose to have
        photographer do this, Location Genie shall own all copyrights in
        photographs taken but these photographs will be made available to you to
        include in your Listing with a watermark or tag bearing the words
        "Location Genie.com Verified Photo" or similar wording ("Verified
        Images"). You agree that you alone are responsible for ensuring that
        your Listing is accurately represented in the Verified Images. You alone
        are responsible for using the Verified Images for your Listing and you
        warrant that you will cease to use the Verified Images or any other
        images if such images cease to accurately represent your Listing or if
        you cease to be a Lister for the Listing featured. All images, materials
        and content created by these photographers, including Verified Images,
        constitute Location Genie Content, regardless of whether you include
        them in your Listing and you agree not to use them except in your
        Listing without prior authorization from Location Genie. If your
        Location Genie Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, you
        shall not use Verified Images in any way. You agree that Location Genie
        retains its right to and may use the Verified Images for advertising,
        marketing, commercial and other business purposes in any media or
        platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without
        further notice or compensation.
      </p>
      <h2>8. No Endorsement</h2>
      <p>
        Location Genie does not endorse any Member, Listing or Property. You
        understand that Verified Images are intended only to indicate a
        photographic representation of the Property at the time the photograph
        was taken. Verified Images are therefore not an endorsement by Location
        Genie of any Member, Listing or Property.
      </p>
      <p>
        Members are required by these Terms to provide accurate information.
        Although Location Genie may, for transparency or fraud prevention or
        detection purposes, directly or through third parties, ask you to
        provide a form of government identification, your date of birth, and
        other information, or undertake additional checks and processes designed
        to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of Members and/or
        screen Member information against third party databases or other
        sources, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse
        any Member or the Member's purported identity or background.
      </p>
      <p>
        By registering for a Location Genie Account, you agree that Location
        Genie may - but is not obligated to - request a consumer report on you
        from a Consumer Reporting Agency. If we do request a consumer report,
        we'll request and use it in compliance with applicable law, including
        the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any references in the Site or Services to a Member being "verified" or
        "connected" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has
        completed a relevant verification or identification process, and does
        not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement,
        certification or guarantee by Location Genie about any Member, including

        information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about

        By using the Site or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or

      <h2>9. Bookings and Financial Terms</h2>
      <p><i>A. Key definitions</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>"Lister Fees"</b> means the fee that Location Genie charges a Lister
        for the use of the Services, which is calculated as a percentage of the
        applicable Property Fees. The Lister Fees will be displayed to the
        Lister when the Lister is asked whether to confirm or reject a booking
        request from a prospective Renter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>"Payment Method"</b> means a payment method that you have added to
        your Location Genie Account, such as a credit card, debit card or
        PayPal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>"Property Fees"</b> means the amounts that are due and payable by a
        Renter in exchange for renting a Property. This includes the Lister
        Fees, the Property Management Fees (if applicable) and the Processing
        Fee. The Lister alone, and not Location Genie, is responsible for
        setting the Property Fees for his or her Listing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>"Property Manager"</b> means a person or a company providing
        assistance to the Lister with listing and renting out the Property.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>"Property Management Fees"</b> means the fee that Property Manager
        charges a Lister for assisting a Lister with listing and renting out the
        Property, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Property
        Fees. The Property Management fees will be displayed to the Renter when
        the Renter is asked whether to send a booking request to a Lister.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>"Service Fees"</b> means collectively the Property Management Fees
        and the Lister Fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>"Processing Fee"</b> means the fee paid by the Renter based on the
        total of Location Fee plus the Additional Fees (if there are Additional
        Fees applicable to the booking). The Processing Fee is reduced as the
        total cost of the booking increases.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>"Additional Fees"</b> are extra fees associated with the use of
        Listing. These are the fees that the host does not benefit from
        personally and are paid by the host to external contractors (e.g.
        Cleaning fee or Site rep fee).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>"Total Fees"</b> means collectively the Property Fees and the Service
        Fees plus any Taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >B. Appointment of Stripe as Limited Payment Collection Agent for
          Lister</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Lister hereby appoints Stripe as the Lister’s limited payment
        collection agent for the purpose of accepting the Property Fees from
        Renters. Each Lister agrees that payment made by a Renter through
        Stripe, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the
        Lister, and the Lister will make the Property available to the Renter in
        the agreed-upon manner as if the Lister has received the Property Fees.
      </p>
      <p><i>C. Bookings and Financial Terms for Listers</i></p>
      <p>
        If you are a Lister and a booking is requested for your Property via the
        Site or Services, you will be required to either preapprove, confirm or
        reject the booking request within the Booking Request Period, otherwise
        the booking request will automatically expire. When a booking is
        requested via the Site or Services, we will share with you (i) the first
        and last name of the Renter who has requested the booking, (ii) a link
        to the Renter's Location Genie Account profile page. If you are unable
        to confirm or decide to reject a booking request within the Booking
        Request Period, any amounts collected by Stripe for the requested
        booking will be refunded to the applicable Renter. When you confirm a
        booking requested by a Renter, Location Genie will send you an email,
        text message or message via the Site confirming such booking, depending
        on the selections you make via the Site and Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stripe will collect the Total Fees from Renters at the time of the
        booking request or upon the Lister's confirmation and will initiate
        payment of the Property Fees (less applicable fees and taxes) to the
        Lister and the Property Management Fees to the Property Manager in most
        cases within 24 hours of the scheduled check-in time of the Renter at
        the applicable Property (except to the extent that a refund is due to
        the Renter).
      </p>
      <p><i>D. Bookings and Financial Terms for Renters</i></p>
      <p>
        The Listers, not Location Genie, are solely responsible for honoring any
        confirmed bookings and making available any Properties reserved through
        the Site and Services. If you, as a Renter, choose to enter into a
        transaction with a Lister for the booking of a Property, you agree and
        understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the
        Lister and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and
        restrictions associated with such Property imposed by the Lister. You
        acknowledge and agree that you, and not Location Genie, will be
        responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that
        Location Genie is not a party to such agreements, and that Location
        Genie (inclusive of all subsidiaries) disclaims all liability arising
        from or related to any such agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a Renter before the Renter
        sends a booking request to a Lister. As noted above, the Lister is
        required to either preapprove, confirm or reject the booking request
        within the Booking Request Period; otherwise, the requested booking will
        be automatically canceled. Upon receipt of your booking request, Stripe
        may initiate a pre-authorization and/or charge a nominal amount to your
        Payment Method. If a requested booking is canceled (i.e. not confirmed
        by the applicable Lister), any amounts collected by Stripe will be
        refunded to such Renter, depending on the selections the Renter makes
        via the Site, and any pre-authorization of such Renter's Payment Method
        will be released, if applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        You as a Renter agree to pay the Total Fees (including the Processing
        Fee) for any booking requested, and in most cases confirmed, in
        connection with your Location Genie Account. Stripe will collect the
        Total Fees pursuant to these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a
        confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.
      </p>
      <p><i>E. Service Fees and Other Fees</i></p>
      <p>
        In consideration for the use of Location Genie's online marketplace and
        platform, Location Genie charges Lister Fees. Stripe collects these
        Lister Fees, and, where applicable, may also collect Taxes in respect of
        the Lister Fees and Property Management Fees. Location Genie deducts the
        Lister Fees and Property Management Fees from the Property Fees before
        remitting the balance to the Lister.
      </p>
      <p>
        More information on any such costs or deductions will be available via
        the Site. More information on Services Fees can be found at

      </p>
      <p><i>F. Cancellations and Refunds</i></p>
      <p>i. Cancellations by Renters</p>
      <p>
        As a Renter, you may cancel any reserved Booking before it is confirmed
        by the Lister without further obligation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a booking is confirmed by a Lister, the following cancellation and
        refund rules apply to Renters:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Cancellation within 24 hours of booking.</i> Any booking cancelled
          by a Renter twenty four (24) hours, or fewer, after booking
          confirmation adheres to Location Genie’s Grace Period cancellation
          policy which merits a full refund to the Renter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Cancellation 48 hours or fewer before the booking start date.</i>
          Any booking cancelled by a Renter forty eight (48) hours, or fewer,
          prior to the start of the booking is non-refundable but for the
          additional fees (in any), which are refunded in full. The processing
          fee is non-refundable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i
            >Cancellation more than 48 hours prior to the booking start date.</i
          >
          For any booking cancelled by a Renter more than forty eight (48) hours
          prior to the start of the booking period, the Renter is eligible for a
          50% refund of the Total location fee and a full refund of additional
          fees (if any). The processing fee is non-refundable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the event a Renter cancels a booking that, pursuant to this Section
        9(f)(i), requires payment in the form of a refund to a Renter or payout
        to a Lister, Location Genie will keep the Property Fees until the day on
        which the cancelled booking was to begin at which time Location Genie
        will begin to process any applicable payments to the Renter and/or
        Lister in accordance with its normal payment policy. For all
        Renter-cancelled bookings, the Lister will be entitled to the Property
        Fees paid to Location Genie as provided in this Section 9(f)(i) less the
        Service Fees payable to Location Genie provided. Failure of a Renter to
        comply with the cancellation provisions of this Section 9(f) shall
        result in the Renter forfeiting his or her or its right to any refund
        and the Renter shall instead be liable for the full Total Fees.
      </p>
      <p>ii. Cancellations by Listers</p>
      <p>
        The cancellation of a confirmed booking by a Lister requires intensive
        logistical support and can impact the high standard of service by which
        Location Genie’s marketplace operates. As such, in the event of any
        cancellation of a confirmed booking by a Lister, Location Genie reserves
        the right to impose penalties on the Lister’s account including
        publishing an automated review indicating a cancelled booking, and
        suspending or terminating the Lister’s account. A cancellation of a
        confirmed booking by a Lister must be made with at least 7 calendar
        days’ notice. Failure to comply with the preceding sentence will result
        in Location Genie charging the Lister the applicable Service Fee and
        Processing Fee. In addition, if any Lister cancels more than one
        confirmed booking, Location Genie may, in its sole discretion, withhold
        future payouts to a Lister to make up for any losses incurred as a
        result of Lister’s initial cancellation. These losses may include but
        are not limited to, the additional costs required to complete a new
        Booking for a Renter that has been displaced by a Lister’s cancellation.
      </p>
      <p>iii. Cancellations by Location Genie</p>
      <p>
        In certain circumstances, Location Genie may decide, in its sole
        discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed
        booking or to issue a refund to a Renter for part or all of the amounts
        charged to the Renter. This may be for extenuating circumstances, an
        emergency, or for any other reason. Additionally, Location Genie
        reserves the right to cancel any booking that it deems fictitious in its
        sole discretion. You hereby agree that Location Genie and the relevant
        Renter or Lister will not have any liability for any such cancellation
        or refund made by Location Genie.
      </p>
      <p>iv. Modification of Bookings with Cancellation Protection</p>
      <p>
        If a Renter requests modification of their booking, for which
        Cancellation Protection was purchased, the following rules apply to the
        Cancellation Protection fee:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the price of the booking (Booking total) increases as a result of
          the modification, the Cancellation Protection fee increases
          respectively;
        </li>
        <li>
          If the price of the booking (Booking total) decreases as a result of
          the modification, the Cancellation Protection fee remains unchanged.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cancellation Protection fee is non-refundable.</p>
      <p><i>G. Fraud and Fraud Prevention </i></p>
      <p>
        Location Genie has fraud detection and prevention processes in place to
        protect and educate Listers against potential fraudulent behavior by
        Renters on the platform. Location Genie’s team can be reached at any
        time by use of the contact page if the Lister desires a manual check on
        a Renter’s behavior and/or identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite Location Genie’s efforts to detect and prevent fraudulent
        behavior, the Lister ultimately has the responsibility to verify the
        identity of Renters that book the Lister’s property. If a Lister
        confirms a booking and is paid out Property Fees from a fraudulent
        Renter, Location Genie reserves the right to collect the applicable
        Property Fees from the Lister once payout has been issued. If Lister
        refuses to return the applicable Property Fees to Location Genie,
        Location Genie may pursue legal avenues to retrieve them; Lister shall
        also reimburse Location Genie for all costs incurred in collecting the
        applicable Property Fees, including, without limitation, court costs and
        attorneys’ fees. In addition, Location Genie may, in its sole
        discretion, withhold future payouts to a Lister to make up for any
        losses incurred as a result of Lister’s initial cancellation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, Location Genie maintains the right to withhold Lister’s
        payout related to potentially fraudulent Renter bookings for a period of
        140 days after payment is made on the platform in order to prevent the
        possibility of Renter-related chargebacks.
      </p>
      <h2>10. Taxes</h2>
      <p>
        Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information
        from our Listers, or to withhold taxes from payouts to Listers, or both.
        For instance, IRS regulations stipulate that we must collect an IRS Form
        W-9 from certain US Listers, and an appropriate IRS Form W-8 (e.g. Form
        W-8BEN) from non-US listers with at least one Listing in the US. You as
        a Lister are solely responsible for keeping the information in your tax
        forms current, complete and accurate. If you as a Lister fail to provide
        us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate
        our obligation (if any) to withhold taxes from payments to you (e.g.
        where you are a US Lister and you fail to provide us with a completed
        IRS Form W-9), we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all
        payouts to you until resolution, to withhold such amounts as required by
        law, or to do both.
      </p>
      <p>
        You as a Lister understand and agree that you are solely responsible for
        determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the
        Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected
        or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. You are also
        solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes
        included or received by you. Location Genie cannot and does not offer
        Tax-related advice to any Members.
      </p>
      <p>
        You understand and acknowledge that appropriate governmental agencies,
        departments or authorities (the <b>"Tax Authority"</b>) where your
        Property is located may require Taxes to be collected from Renters or
        Listers on the amount paid for the right to use and/or occupancy of
        properties, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws
        in jurisdictions may vary.
      </p>
      <h2>11. Renting a Property on Location Genie</h2>
      <p>
        As a Renter, you are responsible for acquiring all the necessary permits
        from all relevant bodies (including but not limited to filming permits,
        parking permits etc.) and insurance policies as well as release forms
        and other documents relevant to the filming process to be performed at
        the Property during the Booking Period. Location Genie can not be held
        liable for Renter not acquiring all the necessary permits and other
        documents relevant to the filming process to be performed at the
        Property during the Booking Period.
      </p>
      <h2>12. Damage to Properties</h2>
      <p>
        As a Renter, you are responsible for leaving the Property in the
        condition it was in when you arrived. You acknowledge and agree that, as
        a Renter, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are
        also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you
        invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Property. In the event
        that a Lister claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage (<b
          >"Damage Claim"</b
        >), including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the cost
        of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items.
      </p>
      <p>
        Listers may choose to include security deposits in their Listings (<b
          >"Security Deposits"</b
        >). Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required
        for the applicable Property. Location Genie will use commercially
        reasonable efforts to address Listers' requests and claims related to
        Security Deposits, but Location Genie is not responsible for
        administering or accepting any Damage Claims by Listers related to
        Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a Lister makes a Damage Claim for a confirmed booking of a Property,
        you as a Renter will be notified of any Damage Claim and given forty
        eight (48) hours to respond. Thereafter, Stripe will collect any such
        costs from you and/or against the Security Deposit. Location
        Genie/Stripe also reserves the right to otherwise collect payment from
        you and pursue any avenues available to Location Genie in this regard in
        situations in which you have been determined, in Location Genie's sole
        discretion, to have damaged any Property, including, but not limited to,
        in relation to any payment requests made by Listers based on a Damage
        Claim, and in relation to any payments made by Location Genie to
        Listers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both Renters and Listers agree to cooperate with and assist Location
        Genie in good faith, and to provide Location Genie with such information
        and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Location Genie,
        in connection with any Damage Claims or other complaints or claims made
        by Members relating to Properties or any personal or other property
        located at a Property or with respect to any investigation undertaken by
        Location Genie or a representative of Location Genie regarding use or
        abuse of the Site or the Services. If you are a Renter, upon Location
        Genie's reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to
        do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution
        process with a Lister, at no cost to you, which process will be
        conducted by Location Genie or a third party selected by Location Genie
        or its insurer, with respect to losses for which the Lister is
        requesting payment from Location Genie.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a Renter, you understand and agree that Location Genie may
        make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy
        related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been
        responsible for or to a Property or any personal or other property
        located at a Property. You agree to cooperate with and assist Location
        Genie in good faith, and to provide Location Genie with such information
        as may be reasonably requested by Location Genie, in order to make a
        claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy,
        including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such
        further acts as Location Genie may reasonably request to assist Location
        Genie in accomplishing the foregoing Security Deposits, if required by a
        Lister, may be applied to any fees due from a Renter overstaying at a
        Listing without the Lister's consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Renter acknowledges that Location Genie holds a security deposit equal
        to 50% of the total location fee 48 hours before the start date of the
        booking, should the location require it. This hold is authorized on the
        credit card used to book the location. If Location Genie is unable to
        successfully authorize the security deposit, the Renter’s booking may be
        subject to the terms of the Location Genie cancellation policy.
      </p>
      <h2>13. Insurance</h2>
      <p>
        A. Location Genie requires the Lister and/or the Renter obtain insurance
        or review their existing policies to make sure their existing insurance
        covers any loss that may arise out of the Booking and use of a
        particular Property by the Renter, its guests, vendors, clients,
        customers or licensees, including policies covering property damage,
        casualty, personal injury, fire, and general liability (the “Liability
        Insurance”). Location Genie disclaims any and all liability for Lister
        or Renter’s failure to be covered by Liability Insurance. To the extent
        Lister has not obtained and does not have Liability Insurance, Location
        Genie shall require Renter to purchase Liability Insurance prior to the
        booking start date. Location Genie shall have no liability for the
        Parties’ failure to obtain Liability Insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        B. Location Genie may offer Renter the opportunity to obtain Liability
        Insurance through the Site. The Renter is not required to purchase the
        Liability Insurance through the Site and may instead purchase Liability
        Insurance through the licensed insurance producer and/or insurance
        company of its choosing. Renter may be asked to provide proof of
        Liability Insurance. The Liability Insurance offered through the Site is
        underwritten by a Lloyd’s syndicate. If Renter elects to purchase
        Liability Insurance through the Site, Renter will see two charges – one
        for the Booking and a second charge for the Liability Insurance.
      </p>
      <h2>14. Overstaying without the Lister's Consent</h2>
      <p>
        Renters agree that a confirmed booking is merely a license granted by
        the Lister to the Renter to enter and use the Listing for the limited
        duration of the confirmed booking and in accordance with the Renter's
        agreement with the Lister. Renters are allowed to be present in the
        Property only within the designated hours that the Lister specifies in
        the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between the
        Lister and Renter and further agree to leave the Property no later than
        the checkout time that the Lister specifies in the Listing or such other
        time as mutually agreed upon between the Lister and Renter. If a Renter
        stays past the agreed upon designated hours or checkout time without the
        Lister's consent, they no longer have a license to stay in the Listing
        and the Lister is entitled to make the Renter leave. In addition,
        Renters agree that the Lister can charge the Renter for periods that the
        Renter stays over the agreed designated hours or period without the
        Lister's consent an additional fee of 1.5 times the average hourly
        Property Fee originally paid by the Renter to cover the inconvenience
        suffered by the Lister, plus all applicable Service Fees, Taxes, and any
        legal expenses incurred by the Lister to make the Renter leave
        (collectively, <b>"Additional Sums"</b>). The Additional Sums will be
        charged in half hour increments. If the Renter's production/event has
        more people on location than originally booked, Location Genie has the
        right to charge the Renter for the extra people, as well as any damages
        and overages based on the evidence provided by the Host. Location Genie
        reserves the right to charge the Renter for any such overages based on
        the Location Agreement.

        and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court
        located in Los Angeles County, Los Angeles, California or a United
        States District Court, Central District of California located in Los
        Angeles, California for any actions for which the parties retain the
        right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of
        competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
        misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade
        secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in
        the Dispute Resolution provision below.
      </p>
      <h2>30. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        If you reside in the United States, you and Location Genie agree that
        any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these
        Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
        validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or
        Collective Content (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding
        arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive
        or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
        prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or
        violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents,
        or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that
        you and Location Genie are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or
        to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class
        action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action,
        or any other representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and
        Location Genie otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not
        consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside
        over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this
        specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this
        "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in
        the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive
        any termination of these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</i> This agreement to arbitrate
        evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal
        Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
        provision. The arbitration will be administered by the American
        Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial
        Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
        Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this
        "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at
        <a
          class="link"
          href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >www.adr.org/arb_med</a
        >
        or by calling the AAA at 1--800--778--7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act
        will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Arbitration Process.</i> A party who desires to initiate arbitration
        must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as
        specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a
        <a
          class="link"
          href="http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >form Demand for Arbitration.</a
        >) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed
        to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the
        parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the
        parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of
        delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the
        arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Arbitration Property and Procedure.</i> Unless you and Location Genie
        otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where
        you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration
        will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Location
        Genie submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the
        arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds
        $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
        Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to
        direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent
        with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Arbitrator's Decision.</i> The arbitrator will render an award within
        the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision
        will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the
        arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be
        entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award
        damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of
        Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for
        which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory
        or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the
        extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's
        individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to
        an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under
        applicable law. Location Genie will not seek, and hereby waives all
        rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and
        expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Fees.</i> Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative
        and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
        However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Location
        Genie will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the
        substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for
        Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as
        measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
        11(b)).
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Changes.</i> Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification"
        section above, if Location Genie changes this "Dispute Resolution"
        section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any
        subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by
        sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the
        date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated"
        date above or in the date of Location Genie's email to you notifying you
        of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will

        (the “Safety Measures”). Location Genie reserves the right to update

      <h2>32. General</h2>
      <p>
        The failure of Location Genie to enforce any right or provision of these
        Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right
        or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be
        effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
        representative of Location Genie. Except as expressly set forth in these
        Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these
        Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms
        or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent
        jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or
        unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
        permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full
        force and effect.
      </p>
      <h2>33. Third party beneficiary</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies
        upon any person other than the parties.
      </p>
      <h2>34. Contacting Location Genie</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact Location
        Genie.
