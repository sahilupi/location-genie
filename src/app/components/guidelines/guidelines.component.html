                        Location Genie's community of hosts and renters is built
                        on a foundation of trust and mutual respect. Our top
                        priority is ensuring a safe and authentic experience for
                        our users, and this means enforcing a set of basic rules
                        and standards. Below is the list of our seven community

                        You should not convey an intent to harm anyone by your
                        words or physical actions. You should not keep or bring

                        dangerous animals to a Location Genie location. You
                        should not create conditions that increase the
                        likelihood of a fire, explosion or chemical spill and
                        emergency exits should be clear and obvious at all

                        threat to a renter, host or location.
