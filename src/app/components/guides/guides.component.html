                          There are certain basic criteria for good composition
                          that, when followed, will aid in the creation of
                          visual balance or dynamic tension. All of the "rules"
                          of composition aren't always necessary to produce a
                          decent photograph. The principles are intended as
                          guidelines rather than dogma, but they can assist you
                          in creating well-balanced pictures that are pleasing
                          to the eye. While the subject may initially catch
                          people's attention, it is the artistry of arrangement
                          that keeps them there. The following are some of the
                          most important components of excellent composition.

                          Photography, the Golden Mean, and Geeky Coolness
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          The Rule Of Thirds dictates the placement of the focus
                          of your photograph. Why?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The rule should actually be called the Rule Of The
                          Golden Mean. Across cultures and history, creators
                          such as artists and architects - and even composers
                          and poets - have adopted the Golden Mean as a ratio
                          that is pleasing to the human eye. Nobody is certain
                          why, but a rectangle with sides in the ratio of
                          1:1.6180339887499... just seems to please the
                          aesthetic sense of the human brain. Simply - it just
                          looks good.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The ratio of height to width of the rule of thirds is
                          1:2/3 (or 2/3:1, depending on whether your photo is
                          oriented down or across). This gives a ratio of 1.5.
                          This ratio, however, is only an approximation of the
                          Golden Mean, which is why the rule of thirds seems to
                          work so well: it is building an approximation of the
                          Golden Mean within the boundaries of your photo.
                          Almost mystically, the Golden Mean seems to be a
                          naturally occurring number, like pi or e. The
                          Fibonacci series of numbers starts with 0 and 1, then
                          adds two numbers to produce the next in the series:
                        </p>
                        <p>0</p>
                        <p>1</p>
                        <p>2</p>
                        <p>3</p>
                        <p>5</p>
                        <p>8</p>
                        <p>13</p>
                        <p>21</p>
                        <p>34</p>
                        <p>55</p>
                        <p>etc.</p>
                        <p>
                          Now, if you take successive ratios of consecutive
                          numbers in the Fibonacci series, you get ratios that
                          more and more closely approach the Golden Mean as you
                          use higher and higher pairs of numbers.

                          What are some additional principles for creating an
                          aesthetically pleasing composition?
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          Some other guidelines for creating a pleasing
                          composition include the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            Simplicity: A composition is usually more appealing
                            when it isn't overly crowded or chaotic. The most
                            important components of the picture can be left out
                            to achieve this.<br />
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Balance: The elements can be balanced in a
                            photograph by evenly distributing them within the
                            frame. This lends an air of stability and order to
                            the photo.<br />
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Texture: Adding texture to a video can add interest
                            and visual appeal. This may be done by including
                            items with varied textures or using light and shade
                            to generate texture.<br />
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Pattern: Repetition of components may create a sense
                            of rhythm and aesthetic appeal by repeating
                            elements. Geometric patterns are one way to do
                            this.<br />
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Contrast: High-contrast images, such as those with
                            bright light and dark shadows or distinct hues, may
                            create a striking and eye-catching composition.
                          </li>

                          What Are Some Of The Most Frequently Made Mistakes
                          When It Comes To Creating An Image?
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          Some common mistakes that people make when composing
                          an image include the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            Taking into account only the frame: It's critical to
                            consider what'll be included in the frame and
                            what'll be excluded. This may be achieved by paying
                            attention to the frame's edges and using the rule of
                            thirds.<br />
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            The focal point is often more beautiful when it
                            isn't centered. This might result in a more dynamic
                            and interesting photograph..<br />
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Busy backgrounds: A busy background may detract from
                            the photo's focus. It is often preferable to have
                            the subject in front of a simple backdrop to avoid
                            this problem.<br />
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            A cluttered composition may be off-putting and
                            unpleasant to look at. It is critical to keep only
                            the most essential components in the frame to avoid
                            this.<br />
                          </li>

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          Some other factors to consider when composing an image
                          include the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            Lighting: Excellent lighting may make a significant
                            impact on the quality of an image. It's critical to
                            notice the direction of the light and take advantage
                            of it.<br />
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Perspective: The viewpoint of an image may have a
                            significant influence on the overall composition.
                            This includes the angle from which the picture is
                            shot as well as the distance between the subject and
                            the camera.<br />
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            The topic of an image is something that piques the
                            viewer's interest and is visually attractive. The
                            construction, lighting, and perspective may be used
                            to achieve this.

                        <p>
                          Take a moment to think about how you want your photo
                          to be divided into thirds both horizontally and
                          vertically before taking the shot. The intersections
                          of these imagined lines suggest four potential
                          locations for the subject's focus in the frame. The
                          choice you make is determined by the subject and how
                          you want that topic to be presented.

                        <p>
                          Leave space for your action. The subject is positioned
                          in the lower-left corner, which we've followed with
                          The Rule Of Thirds and given him plenty of room to run
                          within the frame. Space implies action and stasis. The
                          following two images are the same photograph, cropped

                          You may also apply the rule of thirds principles to
                          the placement of the horizon in your images. The boat
                          and horizon are positioned in the center, which leads
                          to a static aesthetic. In photography, a horizon line
                          may be used to balance an image. Moving the horizon
                          line up or down in an image can alter how everything
                          looks together. The horizon line, for example, may be
                          placed in the middle of a picture to convey stability,
                          while placing the horizon line closer to the top or
                          bottom of an image might create a sensation of
                          movement.

                          Today, photography is characterized by a rapid growth
                          in the development of technology and ideas. Each year,
                          millions of pictures are taken and an astonishing
                          array of new films, cameras and imaging systems enter
                          the market. One of the great attractions of the
                          photography field is the ease with which basic skills
                          can be learned. Unlike some of the older arts that
                          take years of training to produce an acceptable
                          product, anyone can quickly learn how to take a
                          picture; however, photographic techniques must be
                          mastered before you can become an accomplished
                          photographer; therefore, mastery of the basic
                          fundamentals is the foundation upon which you will
                          build your photographic and professional skills as a
                          Navy Photographer’s Mate.

                          Photographic Composition
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          Photographic composition is
                          <em
                            >the pleasing arrangement of subject matter elements
                            within the picture area. </em
                          >Creative photography depends foremost on the
                          photographer's ability to see as the camera sees
                          because a photograph does not reproduce a scene quite
                          the way we see it. The camera sees and records only a
                          small isolated part of the larger scene, reduces it to
                          only two dimensions, frames it, and freezes it. It
                          does not discriminate as we do. When we look at a
                          scene we<em> selectively </em>see only the important
                          elements and more or less ignore the rest. A camera,
                          on the other hand, sees all the details within the
                          field of view. This is the reason some of our pictures
                          are often disappointing. Backgrounds may be cluttered
                          with objects we do not remember, our subjects are
                          smaller in the frame or less striking than we recall,
                          or the entire scene may lack significance and life.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Good pictures are seldom created by chance. To make
                          the most of any subject, you must understand the basic
                          principles of composition. The way you arrange the
                          elements of a scene within a picture, catch the
                          viewer’s attention, please the eye, or make a clear
                          statement are all qualities of good composition. By
                          developing photographic composition skills, you can
                          produce photographs that suggest movement, life,
                          depth, shape, and form, recreating the impact of the
                          original scene.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          How are photographic composition skills developed? You
                          look, you study, you practice. Every time you take a
                          picture, look all around within the viewfinder.
                          Consider the way each element will be recorded and how
                          it relates to the overall composition. You must become
                          thoroughly familiar with the camera and learn how the
                          operation of each control alters the image. Experiment
                          with the camera and look at the results carefully to
                          see if they meet your expectations. With experience
                          and knowledge of your equipment, you begin to "think
                          through your camera" so you are free to concentrate on
                          composition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Devote serious study to the principles of good
                          composition. Study books and magazine articles on
                          composition. You should analyze various media: motion
                          pictures, TV, magazines, books and newspapers, and
                          evaluate what you see. What is good about this picture
                          or that TV image? What is bad about it? What
                          principles of good composition could you apply in a
                          different way to make the picture better. Good or
                          correct composition is impossible to define precisely.
                          There are no hard-and-fast rules to follow that ensure
                          good composition in every photograph. There are only
                          the principles and elements that provide a means of
                          achieving <em>pleasing </em>composition when applied
                          properly. Some of these principles and elements are as
                          follows:

                          As you study these principles of composition, you
                          should soon come to a realization that some are very
                          similar and overlap one another a great deal. Because
                          all or most of these principles must be considered and
                          applied each time you take a picture, it may all seem
                          quite confusing at first. With experience you can
                          develop a sense of composition, and your consideration
                          and application of the principles will become almost
                          second nature. This is not to suggest that you can
                          allow yourself to become complacent or careless in the
                          application of the principles of composition. Doing so
                          will be immediately obvious because the results you
                          produce will be snapshots, not professional
                          photographs. The principles of composition that follow
                          apply equally to both still and motion media
                          photography.

                        <p>
                          Each picture should have only one principal idea,
                          topic, or <em>center of interest </em>to which the
                          viewer's eyes are attracted. Subordinate elements
                          within the picture must support and focus attention on
                          the principal feature so it alone is emphasized. A
                          picture without a dominant center of interest or one
                          with more than one dominant center of interest is
                          puzzling to a viewer. Subsequently, the viewer becomes
                          confused and wonders what the picture is all about.
                          When the picture has one, and only one, dominant
                          "point of interest," the viewer quickly understands
                          the picture.

                          "Point of interest," as used here, has the same
                          meaning as center of interest; however, using the term
                          <em>point of interest </em>prevents giving the
                          impression that the center of interest should be
                          located in the center of the picture.

                          The specific topic, idea, or object to be portrayed
                          must be set in your mind as you prepare to take a
                          picture. When there is nothing in the picture to
                          attract attention to a particular area or object, the
                          eyes wander throughout the scene. The center of
                          interest may be a single object or numerous ones
                          arranged so attention is directed to one definite
                          area. When the center of interest is a single object
                          that fills most of the picture area or one that stands
                          out boldly, such as a white sail against a background
                          of dark water, attention is attracted immediately to
                          it. As may be expected, not all subjects are as simple
                          to arrange or as bold and impressive.

                          A photographer usually has at his or her disposal many
                          factors or elements that can be used and arranged
                          within the picture area to draw or direct attention to
                          the primary idea of the picture. Some of these
                          elements are lines, shapes, human figures, tone, and
                          texture. Human figures attract attention more strongly
                          than almost any other subject matter and unless they
                          are the main object of the photograph should probably
                          be kept out of the picture; for instance, a photograph
                          showing a person standing at some distance in front of
                          a building may leave the observer wondering whether
                          the person or the building is the primary subject.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          When people are included in a scene for comparative
                          size of objects or just for atmosphere, keep them from
                          looking directly at the camera. When people look at
                          the camera and therefore at the viewer of the picture,
                          the viewer tends to return their gaze by looking
                          directly back into their eyes. When they are not the
                          intended point of interest, we miss the statement and
                          purpose of the picture. When people are subordinate
                          elements within the picture and they are looking in a
                          direction other than at the camera, the viewer’s
                          attention is directed from the people to what<em>
                            they are </em
                          >looking at, which <em>should </em>be the center of
                          interest; for example, when people are grouped around
                          a piece of machinery that is the center of interest of
                          the picture, have them look at the machine, rather
                          than the camera.

                          Sometimes good composition is obtained by placing the
                          center of interest in the geometrical center of the
                          picture; it is generally not a good idea to place it
                          there. Too frequently it divides the picture into
                          equal halves and makes the picture uninteresting and
                          difficult to balance. By dividing the picture area
                          into thirds, both vertically and horizontally, and
                          locating the center of interest at one of the
                          intersections of the imaginary lines, you can usually
                          create a feeling of balance to the composition (fig.
                          5-5).

                          In photographic composition there are two general
                          guides for determining the best location for the
                          center of interest. <em>The </em>first is the
                          <em>principle of thirds. The </em>other is
                          <em>dynamic symmetry. </em>In the principle of thirds,
                          the intersection of lines that divide the picture area
                          into thirds are marked by O’s. These intersections are
                          good locations for the center of interest in most
                          photographs. Notice we said THE center of interest.
                          Remember, have only one center of interest to a
                          picture-keep it simple. The principle of dynamic
                          symmetry is a similar idea. A good location for the
                          center of interest is found by drawing or imagining a
                          diagonal line from one corner to an opposite corner.
                          Then, draw a second line perpendicular to the first
                          from a third corner (fig. 5-6). The intersections of
                          the lines are the location for the center of
                          interest.<br />

                        <h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
                        <p>
                          Simplicity is the key to most good pictures. The
                          simpler and more direct a picture is, the clearer and
                          stronger is the resulting statement. There are several
                          things to be considered when we discuss simplicity.
                          First, select a subject that lends itself to a simple
                          arrangement; for example, instead of photographing an
                          entire area that would confuse the viewer, frame in on
                          some important element within the area. Second, select
                          different viewpoints or camera angles. Move around the
                          scene or object being photographed. View the scene
                          through the camera viewfinder. Look at the foreground
                          and background. Try high and low angles as well as
                          normal eye-level viewpoints. Evaluate each view and
                          angle. Only after considering all possibilities should
                          you take the picture. See beyond and in front of your
                          subject.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Be sure there is nothing in the background to distract
                          the viewer's attention from the main point of the
                          picture. Likewise, check to see there is nothing
                          objectionable in the foreground to block the entrance
                          of the human eye into the picture. A last point of
                          simplicity-<em>tell only one story. </em>Ensure there
                          is only enough material in the picture to convey one
                          single idea. Although each picture is composed of
                          numerous small parts and contributing elements, none
                          should attract more of the viewer's attention than the
                          primary object of the picture. The primary object is
                          the reason the picture is being made in the first
                          place; therefore, all other elements should merely
                          support and emphasize the main object.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Do not allow the scene to be cluttered with confusing
                          elements and lines that detract from the primary point
                          of the picture. Select a viewpoint that eliminates
                          distractions so the principal subject is readily
                          recognized. When numerous lines or shapes are
                          competing for interest with the subject, it is
                          difficult to recognize the primary object or determine
                          why the picture was made.
                        </p>

                          Viewpoint And Camera Angle
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          The proper viewpoint or camera angle is an important
                          factor in good composition. Repositioning your subject
                          within the viewfinder frame and changing the camera
                          viewpoint or camera angle are two simple ways of
                          controlling composition. Photographing from a
                          different viewpoint or camera angle can often add
                          drama and excitement or even bring out an unusual
                          aspect of a subject. Most of the subjects you
                          photograph are three-dimensional and should be
                          photographed from an angle (to the right or left of
                          and/or from higher or lower than the subject) that
                          allows the viewer to see more than one side of the
                          subject. The photographer should study the subject
                          from different sides and angles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Walk around the subject and look at it from all
                          viewpoints. See it from elevated and low positions as
                          well as from eye level to find the best composition.
                          This greatly assists in composing the subject for the
                          best balance and helps to select a background that
                          compliments, not distracts from the subject. The terms
                          <em>viewpoint </em>and <em>camera angle </em>are often
                          used in conjunction with one another and sometimes
                          used interchangeably. They can also have different
                          meanings depending on how they are applied. Viewpoint"
                          is the camera position in relation to the subject.

                          "Camera angle" is the angle in which the camera lens
                          is tilted; for example, a picture of sailors marching,
                          made from ground level with the camera held horizontal
                          with reference to the ground, may be referred to as a
                          "low viewpoint" (or camera position); however, when
                          this picture is made, again from ground level, but
                          with the camera pointed up, it may be referred to as a
                          "low camera angle." Likewise, a picture made from an
                          elevated or high position, with the camera again held
                          horizontal with reference to the ground, or even
                          pointed straight down, can be referred to as a "high
                          viewpoint"; however, if the camera is not held
                          horizontal to the ground or pointed straight down, but
                          pointed at some angle between horizontal and vertical,
                          the camera position could be referred to as a "high
                          camera angle."

                          With the camera held horizontal, eye-level shots are
                          usually made at a height of about 5 1/2 feet, the
                          height from which the average adult sees, and with the
                          camera horizontal. With the camera held at eye level
                          but pointed up or down, the camera position changes
                          and you have either a low or high camera angle,

                          Low viewpoints and low camera angles can add emphasis
                          and interest to many ordinary photographs. A low
                          viewpoint can be used to distort scale or add strength
                          to a picture or to emphasize certain elements within
                          the picture. A low camera angle is achieved when the
                          camera angle is located below the point of primary
                          interest and pointed upward. Low angles tend to lend
                          strength and dominance to a subject and dramatize the
                          subject. Low angle shots are used when dramatic impact
                          is desired. This type of shot is very useful for
                          separating the subject from the background, for
                          eliminating unwanted foreground and background, and
                          for creating the illusion of greater size and speed
                          (fig. 5-7).

                        <p>
                          Balance in photographic composition is a matter of
                          making pictures look harmonious. Each element in a
                          picture has a certain amount of value in respect to
                          all the other elements. Every tone, mass, shape, tree,
                          rock figure, building, line, or shadow contributes a
                          certain amount of weight that must be arranged
                          correctly in the composition to give the impression of
                          balance. The subject placement within the picture area
                          is the factor that must be carefully considered.
                          Composition is kept in balance by two different
                          methods: symmetrical, or formal, balance and
                          asymmetrical, or informal, balance.

                          <strong>Symmetrical Or Formal Balance</strong>
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          Symmetrical or formal balance in a photograph is
                          achieved when elements on both sides of the picture
                          are of equal weight (fig. 5-9A). The idea of formal
                          balance can be related to a seesaw, When there are two
                          equally weighted objects on the seesaw and they are
                          equidistant from the pivot point, or fulcrum, the
                          board will be in balance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Pictures with formal balance may look static and
                          unexciting; however, they do present an air of
                          dignity. Formal balance does not always mean a picture
                          has to the seesaw in perspective. The forces or
                          weights are symmetrical. Symmetrical pictures, in
                          which both are presumed to be approximately equal;
                          but, the imaginary sides are exactly the same, are
                          produced only when your pivot point is set deep into
                          the picture space. With this want a special effect;
                          therefore, they are not often variation to symmetrical
                          balance, a more interesting product. A variation of
                          symmetrical balance deals with photographs is usually
                          created (fig. 5-9B).

                        <p>
                          Asymmetrical, or informal, balance is usually much
                          more interesting than symmetrical balance. In
                          asymmetrical balance the imaginary central pivot point
                          is still presumed to be present; however, instead of
                          mirror images on each side of the picture area, the
                          subject elements are notably different in size, shape,
                          weight, tone, and placement. Balance is established by
                          equalizing the element forces in spite of their
                          differences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Asymmetrical balance is introduced when the presumed
                          weight of two or more lighter objects is equalized by
                          a single heavier object placed on the other side of
                          the imaginary pivot point (fig. 5-10). Asymmetrical
                          balance is more difficult to achieve than symmetrical
                          balance, because of the problem of establishing
                          relative weight values for dissimilar elements within
                          the picture area as well as presenting some form of
                          stability.<br />

                            An object far from the center of the picture seems
                            to have more weight than one near the center.

                            Objects in the upperpart of a picture seem heavier
                            than objects of the same size in the lower part of a
                            picture.

                          <li>
                            Isolation seems to increase the weight of an object.

                          <li>

                          <li>
                            Regular shapes seem to have more weight than

                          </li>

                            Elements on the right side of an asymmetrical
                            picture appear to have more weight than elements of

                            The directions in which figures, lines, and shapes
                            appear to be moving within the picture area are
                            important to balance; for example, a person may be
                            walking in a direction, or his eyes may be looking
                            in a direction, or the shape of some element creates
                            a feeling of movement. When the feeling of direction
                            is present within a scene, it tends to upset the
                            balance if judged on the size of the subject alone.

                          Understanding the factors required to create pictorial
                          balance is essential for you to produce good pictures.
                          To gain this understanding, you can continually test
                          your feelings for balance as you look through your
                          camera viewfinder. Once you gain an understanding of
                          the principles of pictorial balance, achieving balance
                          in your photographs becomes an easy process.<br />

                        <p>
                          The term strength pertains to the ability of your
                          image to attract the viewer's attention. You should
                          remember that the average person viewing images has an
                          attention span approximating that of a three-year-old
                          child. &nbsp;If you're not able to gain attention
                          immediately, your image will be discarded. Clarity
                          refers to the ability of your image to maintain the
                          viewer's interest. &nbsp;This is accomplished by
                          allowing the viewer to explore the parts and
                          subtleties of the image. &nbsp;You must provide a
                          mechanism for the viewer's eye to use to examine all
                          parts of the scene and return to the main focus.
                          &nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The viewer will abandon the image before examining the
                          various parts and subtleties if the image lacks
                          strength. &nbsp;Both strength and clarity must be
                          present.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In composition, there are several principles and
                          elements available to enhance strength and clarity.
                          &nbsp;While composing the image, the photographer
                          becomes a chef who takes a certain number of
                          ingredients and mixes them in just the right
                          proportion to create a presentable dish.
                          &nbsp;Initially, a photographer must determine which
                          design principles are important for creating the
                          image.
                        </p>
                        <p>Design elements include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Eye flow</li>
                          <li>
                            Elements in the scene that guide the viewer's eye
                            through the entire frame.
                          </li>
                          <li>Dominant element</li>
                          <li>
                            Usually there is one main subject to the image.
                            &nbsp;The subject may be either a single object, or
                            a relationship.
                          </li>
                          <li>Simplicity</li>
                          <li>
                            Only what is essential to the scene is included in
                            the final image.
                          </li>
                          <li>Balance</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          A second consideration is the <em>application</em> of
                          design elements to create clarity in such familiar
                          applications such as:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Lines</li>
                          <li>Shapes</li>
                          <li>Patterns</li>
                          <li>Textures</li>
                          <li>Color (Tone)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          Finally, there are photographic elements that add
                          strength to the image. &nbsp;These elements include
                          such aspects as:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Format (portrait or landscape)</li>
                          <li>Placement of the main elements</li>
                          <li>Lens Selection</li>
                          <li>Focusing</li>
                          <li>Perspective</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          One method of creating strength in an image is to
                          create focal points that draw the viewer's eye to that
                          area. &nbsp;Focal points compel the viewer to look at
                          them first. &nbsp;There are several techniques that
                          create strong focal points. &nbsp;First, the
                          photographer can isolate the subject. &nbsp;Throwing
                          everything in the scene out of focus except for the
                          main subject is one example of this technique.
                          &nbsp;The viewer's eye is attracted to whatever is
                          sharp in the image. &nbsp;The viewer's eye generally
                          will not remain very long in an area that is out of
                          focus. &nbsp;However, when everything is in sharp
                          focus, the image becomes cluttered and won't hold the
                          viewer's attention. &nbsp;Having too many things to
                          look at causes fatigue in the viewer's eye. &nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Having a contrast in tone or color between parts of
                          the image is another method that creates a strong
                          focal point. When you're dividing the image space by
                          tone or color, it's important to examine how the
                          division occurs. If the image is equally divided
                          between two tones, the viewer becomes confused,
                          because each portion of the image has equal weight.
                          For example, consider the classic sunset image. If the
                          horizon line is placed in the center of the frame,
                          both the sky and water take up an equal amount of
                          space. The viewer feels uneasy, because the
                          photographer didn't provide any visual clues as to
                          what is most important in the scene. This type of
                          image lacks strength, and the viewer will quickly
                          abandon it. One curative option is to lower the
                          horizon, which places emphasis on the clouds in the
                          sky. Raising the horizon places emphasis on the
                          reflections in the water. Which is best? The
                          photographer must decide whether the sky or water is
                          more attractive. If the photographer can't decide and
                          splits the frame equally, their indecisiveness will be
                          apparent to the viewer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Placement of elements in the frame can also create
                          focal points. Key placement questions to consider
                          include what, how, and where to place elements in the
                          scene. You should articulate what attracts you in the
                          scene. That will dictate what to place in the final
                          image. If the photographer can't articulate what
                          causes their personal passion in a scene, passion
                          won't come across to the viewer. How you place
                          something in the image refers to whether the element
                          is fully or partially visible. Showing the entire
                          element increases the attentive values of that
                          element. Partially showing the element decreases the
                          emphasis on that element. &nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          When you want to stress the relationship between two
                          elements in the scene, rather than the elements
                          individually, place them partially out of the image or
                          near the edges of the frame. Where to place the main
                          elements in the image is the final consideration for
                          attracting the viewer's attention. The Rule of Thirds
                          is the most common method for determining where to
                          place the main elements. It's based on the concept
                          that the strength of an image improves when the main
                          elements are placed at key locations away from the
                          center of the frame.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We've been programmed to locate main elements in the
                          center of the frame. &nbsp;Do you remember when you
                          were a child, and the teacher told you to draw a red
                          flower with your crayon? &nbsp;Where did you place it?
                          &nbsp;You probably began in the center of the page.
                          &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;There was lots of room there, so you
                          could draw the entire flower. &nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Your first camera was probably of the point-and-shoot
                          variety. &nbsp;The only area that confirmed the
                          subject was in focus was the focus point in the center
                          of the camera lens. &nbsp;If you can determine focus
                          in the center of your field of view, isn't it logical
                          to place your subject there? &nbsp;The problem, of
                          course, is that placing the subject in the center of
                          the frame normally provides little interest for the
                          viewer. &nbsp;The brain is logical. If the brain
                          subconsciously expects to find something in the center
                          of a picture, and it's located there, no excitement is
                          generated. &nbsp;Placing the subject away from the
                          center provides visual stimulation.

                        <h3 id="rule-of-thirds">Rule of Thirds</h3>
                        <p>
                          Before talking about when it's permissible to break
                          the Rule of Thirds, let's make sure that we understand
                          how it works. &nbsp;Several schools of thought in
                          ancient Greece searched for mathematical formulas for
                          the perfect number, chord, etc. They also searched for
                          perfect balance in their artwork. &nbsp;Renaissance
                          architects and painters continued the search for
                          perfection. &nbsp;They decided that the relationship
                          of five to eight created such balance. &nbsp;Divide
                          the length of the canvas (or picture frame) into eight
                          parts, and at the fifth mark from the left, draw a
                          line from top to bottom. &nbsp;Count five parts,
                          starting from the opposite side, and do the same
                          thing. &nbsp;Draw two lines in the same manner from
                          the width of the frame, and the end result is figure 1
                          below.

                          This is called the Golden Triangle because it
                          represents the perfect division of space. The points
                          where the lines intersect are called power points.
                          Placing your main subject at one of the power points
                          gives it a high attentive value and adds strength to
                          your image. If there's more than one main subject,
                          placing each at a power point provides balance and
                          strength.

                          It's difficult to visually divide the viewfinder into
                          eight equal parts. Therefore, it's easier to use the
                          Rule of Thirds, which divides the viewfinder into
                          three sections, both horizontally and vertically. As
                          you can see from Figure 2 (at right), the Golden Mean
                          is a tighter grouping than the Rule of Thirds. Both
                          methods use the power point concept for placing the
                          main subject(s).

                          The image below (the rose surrounded by baby's breath)
                          demonstrates locating the subject according to the
                          Rule of Thirds. &nbsp;The placement, as well as the
                          color contrast, almost requires the viewer's eye to go
                          to the rose first. &nbsp;After stopping at the rose,
                          the eye is free to wander about the rest of the image
                          to explore its content. &nbsp;Therefore, the image has
                          both strength and clarity. <br />

                          Consider the Rule of Thirds to be the Guidelines of
                          Thirds. &nbsp;If the main subject is always placed at
                          one of four points in the frame, creativity suffers.
                          &nbsp;There are many situations where using the Rule
                          of Thirds will enhance the image. &nbsp;Other
                          situations require more creativity, and that means
                          bending or breaking this rule.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The Rule of Thirds discourages placing an important
                          element in the center of the frame. &nbsp;However,
                          there are two situations when a centrally placed
                          element works effectively. &nbsp;The first situation
                          arises when there's nothing else in the scene that
                          competes with the main subject. &nbsp;If a flower is
                          in sharp focus and everything else is out of focus,
                          the viewer's eye will go to the flower--no matter
                          where it's placed in the scene. &nbsp;Placing the
                          flower in the center of the frameworks, in this
                          instance, because the flower is a complete subject on
                          its own, and there are no other elements to compete
                          with the flower.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The other situation in which a centrally placed
                          element works occurs when there's a strong sense of
                          balance in the scene. &nbsp;Imagine the hub of a
                          wooden wagon wheel. &nbsp;The hub can be placed in the
                          center, because the radiating spokes suggest a strong
                          balance within the scene. &nbsp;Placing a strong
                          horizontal line in the center of the frame works only
                          when one half of the scene is reflected in the other
                          half. &nbsp;Notice that the image below has a strong
                          horizontal line (tree line) in the center of the
                          frame. &nbsp;The image works due to the strong sense
                          of balance in the scene. &nbsp;In this case, placing
                          the horizontal line anywhere else in the frame would
                          degrade the image dramatically. &nbsp;

                        <p>
                          As stated previously, placing the horizon in the
                          center of the frame can confuse the viewer as to
                          what's important. &nbsp;The underlying structure of
                          the Rule of Thirds allows us to modify the location of
                          the horizon to send a clear message to the viewer. The
                          Rule of Thirds can be used to visually weigh an image.
                          Visual weight differs from physical weight.
                          &nbsp;Light colors have less visual weight than dark
                          colors when they fill approximately the same amount of
                          space in the frame. &nbsp;Thus, a large mound of dark
                          feathers appears heavier than a white rabbit of equal
                          size. &nbsp;Also, an element that takes up more
                          physical space in the frame has more visual weight
                          than an element that uses less space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We can bottom weight an image by placing the top of
                          our visually weighted element along the lower
                          horizontal line of our Rule of Thirds grid.
                          &nbsp;Locating the top of the element below the lower
                          horizontal line places gives it less emphasis.
                          &nbsp;It's up to the photographer to determine how
                          much emphasis should be placed on each element in the
                          scene. &nbsp;The image below is an example of a
                          bottom-weighted image. <br />

                          Placing the visual weight at the bottom of the image
                          puts emphasis on the upper portions of the image.
                          &nbsp;In the image to the left, it's really the
                          interesting clouds that make the image. &nbsp;The
                          mountains simply provide a sense of place. &nbsp;If
                          the mountains were seen higher in the image, they
                          would detract from the clouds. &nbsp;The image would
                          change and not be as interesting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We can also top-weight an image by placing it along
                          the upper horizontal line in the Rule of Thirds grid.
                          &nbsp;The two images below are both top-weighted. You
                          probably get a different feel from each of them - even
                          though they're both images of the Grand Tetons taken
                          from the same tripod holes. &nbsp;The difference is
                          that the image on the right has a stronger base.
                          &nbsp;When you build a house, it needs to have a
                          strong foundation to stand.

                          The same is true with an image. &nbsp;The Grand Tetons
                          have a lot of visual weight. &nbsp;The viewer can
                          easily determine that they are heavy. &nbsp;In
                          contrast, the grassland in the foreground of each
                          image doesn't represent weight. &nbsp;Top-weighting an
                          image without a strong base makes the weighted object
                          appear to be floating on a surface that won't support
                          it. &nbsp;Therefore, the viewer senses something
                          doesn't appear right in the image, even if they can't
                          verbalize the problem. &nbsp;The above images are
                          extreme examples. The image on the above left has a
                          weak base because the bottom of the mountains is too
                          high. The image on the right represents moving the
                          bottom of the mountain to an extremely low base. It
                          sends a better message about the solid feel of the
                          image. Probably the best location for the bottom of
                          the mountain would be somewhere between both images.

                          images involving water in the foreground. &nbsp;Unless
                          there's some other foreground object, the viewer can
                          feel uncomfortable with nothing but water supporting

                          image to the left. &nbsp; When you cover the rocks in
                          the foreground, do you get the feeling that the
                          mountain is floating on the water? &nbsp;We know that
                          mountains can't float, so the viewer may feel some
                          negative tension from the image.

                          In top-weighted images, the photographer must decide
                          whether a top-weighted image is supported by the
                          foreground and how much foreground to include.
                          &nbsp;Although it's your decision, be aware of the
                          concept of base and potential viewer reaction to the
                          shot. We used the horizontal grid lines of the Rule of
                          Thirds to create either top or bottom weight in our
                          image. &nbsp;The vertical grid lines can also be used;
                          it's called side-weighting. &nbsp;The image below
                          right is an example of using the left vertical line of
                          the grid to locate the main element of the image.
                          &nbsp;Notice that the small stream of water is placed
                          along the other vertical line in the grid.
                          &nbsp;Placing the main element closer to the edge puts
                          less emphasis on that element. &nbsp;On some
                          occasions, leaving part of the element out of the
                          scene creates an emphasis on the relationship between
                          that element and another element in the scene.

                          While the main element can be placed on either
                          vertical line, care must be taken to avoid creating
                          negative tension. &nbsp;If there's any action, or
                          implied action, in the scene, the action should
                          normally be located toward the center of the frame.
                          &nbsp;For example, if the main element of the scene
                          were a bicyclist, the bicycle would move from the edge
                          of the frame toward the center. &nbsp;If the bicycle
                          were located at either vertical line and appeared to
                          move toward the closer edge of the frame, the viewer
                          might wonder where the bicycle will go once it leaves
                          the frame. &nbsp;This situation is called amputation,
                          because the edge of the frame cuts off the ability of
                          the viewer to follow the anticipated action. &nbsp;Any
                          implied action, such as a person looking out of the
                          frame, can cause the same result.

                          Counter culture placement of the subject is another
                          way of increasing tension in a photo. &nbsp;In western
                          culture, movement is generally left to right.
                          &nbsp;That's how you're reading this page. &nbsp;If
                          the movement in the scene is from right to left (even
                          though it's moving toward the center), it can create
                          negative tension for western viewers. The next set of
                          three images shows a wolf looking in different
                          directions. &nbsp;You'll probably receive a different
                          feeling from each of the images--depending on the
                          direction of the wolf's stare. &nbsp;Do any of the
                          images give you a feeling of nervousness or curiosity?

                          Remember my earlier statement that rigidly following
                          rules discourages creativity. &nbsp;There may be
                          occasions when you want to add negative tension to a
                          scene to create a certain mood. &nbsp;Intentionally
                          creating a feeling of amputation can add mystery.
                          Counter-cultural movement inserts a subtle tension
                          that many people feel but can't verbalize. The
                          question boils down to the photographer being able to
                          say what's important in the scene, and then to create
                          circumstances that will allow the viewer to receive
                          the intended message.

                        <p>
                          Thus far, we've discussed the Rule of Thirds as a
                          basic model and expanded it into a creative approach
                          for placing the main subject in the frame. The
                          preceding suggestions will add strength and generate
                          viewer attention to your images. The Golden Mean and
                          Rule of Thirds provide a sense of order, balance, and
                          beauty to the image. But is this all we want to say in
                          photography? &nbsp;Using only the Rule of Thirds will
                          eventually create monotonous, boring shots where
                          placement is always the same as regulated by the rule.
                          To maintain viewer interest, you need variety, and
                          that comes from creative placement. Let your
                          creativity be your guide!<br />

                        <p>
                          As a photographer, you work with light to produce
                          quality pictures. The color, direction, quantity, and
                          quality of the light you use determines how your
                          subjects appear. In the studio, with artificial light
                          sources, you can precisely control these four effects;
                          however, most of the pictures you make are taken
                          outdoors. Daylight and sunlight are not a constant
                          source, because they change hourly and with the
                          weather, season, location, and latitude. This changing
                          daylight can alter the apparent shapes, colors, tones,
                          and forms of a scene. The color of sunlight changes
                          most rapidly at the extreme ends of the day. Strong
                          color changes also occur during storms, haze, or mist
                          and on blue wintery days. The direction of light
                          changes as the sun moves across the sky. The shape and
                          direction of shadows are altered, and the different
                          directions of sunlight greatly affect the appearance
                          of a scene.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The quality of sunlight depends on its strength and
                          direction. Strong, direct sunlight is "hard" because
                          it produces dark, well-defined shadows and brilliant
                          highlights, with strong modeling of form. Sunlight is
                          hardest on clear summer days at noon. Strong sunlight
                          makes strong colors more brilliant, but weak colors
                          pale. Sunlight is diffused by haze, mist, and
                          pollution in the air. This diffused or reflected light
                          is softer; it produces weak, soft shadows and dull
                          highlights. Directionless, diffused sunlight is often
                          called "flat" lighting because it produces fine detail
                          but subdues or flattens form. Weak, directionless
                          sunlight provides vibrant, well-saturated colors.

                        <h3 id="frontlighting">Frontlighting</h3>
                        <p>
                          The old adage about keeping the sun at your back is a
                          good place to continue our discussion of outdoor
                          lighting. The type of lighting created when the sun is
                          in back of the photographer is called frontlighting.
                          This over-the-shoulder lighting was probably the first
                          photographic advice you ever received. This may seem
                          to be a universal recipe for good photography. But it
                          is not. The case against over-the-shoulder lighting is
                          it produces a flattened effect, doing nothing to bring
                          out detail or provide an impression of depth. The
                          human eye sees in three dimensions and can compensate
                          for poor lighting. A photograph is only
                          two-dimensional; therefore, to give an impression of
                          form, depth, and texture to the subject, you should
                          ideally have the light come from the side or at least
                          at an angle.

                          As you gain experience with various types of outdoor
                          lighting, you discover that interesting effects can be
                          achieved by changing the angle of the light falling on
                          your subject. As you turn your subject, change the
                          camera viewpoint, or wait for the sun to move, the
                          light falls more on one side, and more shadows are
                          cast on the opposite side of the subject. For pictures
                          in which rendering texture is important, side lighting
                          is ideal.

                          Look at a brick wall, first in direct front sunlight
                          and then in side lighting. Direct, front sunlight
                          shows the pattern of the bricks and mortar in a flat,
                          uninformative way, but side lighting creates shadows
                          in every little crevice (fig. 5-24). The effect
                          increases as the light is more parallel with the wall
                          until long shadows fall from the smallest irregularity
                          in the brickwork This can give an almost 3-D effect to
                          a photograph.

                          Side lighting is particularly important with
                          black-and- white photography that relies on gray
                          tones, rather than color, to record the subject.
                          Shadows caused by side lighting reveal details that
                          can create striking pictures from ordinary objects
                          that are otherwise hardly worth photographing in black
                          and white. Anything that has a noticeable texture-like
                          the ripples of sand on a beach, for example-gains
                          impact when lit from the side. Landscapes, buildings,
                          people, all look better when sidelighted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This applies to color photography as well. Color gives
                          the viewer extra information about the subject that
                          may make up for a lack of texture in frontlighting,
                          but often the result is much better when lit from the
                          side. Pictures made with side lighting usually have
                          harsh shadows and are contrasty. To lighten the
                          shadows and reduce the contrast, you may want to use
                          some type of reflector to direct additional skylight
                          into the shadow areas or use fill-in flash, whichever
                          is more convenient.

                        <p>
                          When the sun is in front of the photographer, coming
                          directly at the camera, you have what is referred to
                          as backlighting; that is, the <em>subject </em>is
                          backlit. This type of lighting can be very effective
                          for pictures of people outdoors in bright sunlight. In
                          bright sunlight, when subjects are front-lighted or
                          even sidelighted, they may be uncomfortable and squint
                          their eyes. Backlighting helps to eliminate this
                          problem. Backlighting may also require the use of a
                          reflector or fill-in flash to brighten up the dark
                          shadows and improve subject detail. Backlighting is
                          also used to produce a silhouette effect. When you use
                          backlighting, avoid having the sun rays fall directly
                          on the lens (except for special effects). A lens hood
                          or some other means of shading the lens should be used
                          to prevent lens flare.

                        <p>
                          Existing light photography, sometimes called available
                          or natural light photography, is the making of
                          pictures by the light that happens to be on the scene.
                          This includes light from table, floor, and ceiling
                          lights, neon signs, windows, skylights, candles,
                          fireplaces, automobile headlights, and any other type
                          of light that provides the natural lighting of a
                          scene-except daylight outdoors. (Moonlight is
                          considered an existing light.) Existing light then is
                          that type of light found in the home, in the office,
                          in the hangar bay, in the chapel, in the club, in the
                          sports arenas, and so on. Outdoor scenes at twilight
                          or after dark are also existing light situations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Photography by existing light produces pictures that
                          look natural. Even the most skillfully lighted flash
                          picture may look artificial when compared to a good
                          existing light photography. With existing light
                          photography, the photographer has an opportunity to
                          make dramatic, creative pictures. Existing light
                          allows the photographer greater freedom of movement
                          because extra lighting equipment is not required.
                          Subject distance, when not using flash, has no effect
                          on exposure; therefore, you can easily photograph
                          distant subjects that could not otherwise be
                          photographed using flash or some other means of
                          auxiliary lighting. With existing light, you can make
                          pictures that could not be taken with other types of
                          lighting; for example, flash may not be appropriate
                          during a change of command ceremony or chapel service.
                          Not only can the flash disturb the proceedings, but it
                          may not carry far enough to light the subject
                          adequately.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          For existing light pictures, your camera should be
                          equipped with a fast lens-at least f/2.8, but
                          preferably about f/1.4. The camera shutter should have
                          a B or T setting, and for exposures longer than about
                          1/60 second, you need a tripod or other means of
                          supporting the camera.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Because the level of illumination for many existing
                          light scenes is quite low, you may want to consider
                          using a high-speed film. When making pictures with
                          plenty of existing light or when you particularly want
                          long exposures for special effect, you can use a
                          slower film; however, the advantages of high-speed
                          film are as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            Allows you to get adequate exposure for hand-held
                            shots.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Allows you to use faster shutter speeds to reduce
                            camera and image motion.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Permits the use of longer focal-length lenses when
                            the camera is hand-held.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Allows the use of smaller f/stops for greater depth
                            of field.
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          When you are making existing-light color pictures
                          indoors of scenes illuminated by tungsten light, use a
                          tungsten type of film. When the light for your indoor
                          color pictures is daylight from a window or skylight,
                          use a daylight type of color film or use tungsten film
                          with a No. 85B filter. Always use an exposure meter to
                          calculate your indoor existing light exposure. When a
                          bright window is included in the background, take a
                          closeup meter reading of the subject to prevent the
                          meter from being overly influenced by light from the
                          window.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Pictures made indoors by existing daylight are
                          pleasing to the viewer, because of the soft diffused
                          light and the squint-free expression of your subjects.
                          Open all the window drapes in the room to get the
                          highest level of illumination possible. Pose your
                          subject to allow diffused daylight to fall on the
                          front or side of their face.Try not to pose your
                          subject in a position where too much of the facial
                          features are in shadow, unless you are trying for a
                          special effect, such as a silhouette. When you
                          photograph your subject in direct non diffused
                          sunlight coming through a window, you have more light
                          to work with, but the light is contrasty and your
                          subject has a tendency to squint.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Indoor existing light, artificial or otherwise, may be
                          quite contrasty; for example, when your subjects are
                          close to the source of light and well-illuminated,
                          while other areas of the scene are comparatively dark.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          By turning on all the lights in the room, you can make
                          the illumination more even and provide additional
                          light for exposure and at the same time reduce the
                          scene contrast. The contrast created by some
                          artificial lighting can also be reduced in an average
                          size room by bouncing auxiliary light off the ceiling
                          or by using reflectors. Adding auxiliary bounce
                          lighting or reflectors means you are not making true
                          existing light pictures, but this extra light helps to
                          reduce contrast without spoiling the natural
                          appearance of the scene.

                        <h3 id="fluorescent-lighting">Fluorescent Lighting</h3>
                        <p>
                          Indoor scenes illuminated by fluorescent lights
                          usually appear pleasing and natural in real life;
                          however, color pictures of these same scenes often
                          have an overall color cast that makes them appear
                          unnatural. Fluorescent light emits blue and green
                          light primarily and is deficient in red light. Most
                          color pictures made without a filter under fluorescent
                          light are also deficient in red and have an overall
                          greenish appearance. Used correctly, fluorescent light
                          has some advantages over other types of available
                          light.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          A room illuminated by fluorescent lamps is usually
                          brighter and more evenly lighted than a room
                          illuminated by tungsten lamps. This higher level of
                          light makes it easier to get enough exposure for your
                          existing light photography and helps record detail
                          that may have been lost in the shadow areas with other
                          types of existing light. When photographing people,
                          however, fluorescent lighting often causes dark
                          shadows under the subject's eyes. These shadows cause
                          the eyes to appear dark and sunk in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          For making color pictures under fluorescent lighting,
                          a negative color film with the appropriate filter is
                          most often your best bet. Color negative film has a
                          wide exposure latitude that permits, to some extent, a
                          variation in exposure without detracting from the
                          quality of the finished print. The greenish effect
                          caused by fluorescent lighting can be partially
                          corrected when the color negatives are printed. For
                          color slides with fluorescent light, a daylight type
                          of film with the appropriate filter is best. Tungsten
                          film usually produces slides with too much blue or
                          green when made with fluorescent light.

                          Pictures Outdoors at Night
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          Outdoor night scenes usually include large areas of
                          darkness broken by smaller areas of light from
                          buildings, signs, and streetlights. Pictures of
                          outdoor scenes are quite easy to make because good
                          results are obtainable over a wide range of exposures.
                          Using short exposures emphasizes well-lit areas by
                          preserving the highlight detail, while the shadow
                          areas are dark because of underexposure. Long
                          exposures help retain the detail of the dark areas,
                          while highlight detail is lost because of
                          overexposure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Large, dark areas in night scenes make it difficult to
                          make accurate exposure meter readings from your camera
                          position. The best meter reading results are obtained
                          when you take closeup readings of important scene
                          areas. Color outdoor pictures at night can be made on
                          either daylight or tungsten-type films. Pictures made
                          on daylight film have a warm, yellow-red appearance.
                          Those made on tungsten film have a colder, more
                          natural look; however, both films provide pleasing
                          results, so it is a matter of personal preference
                          which you use. A good time to make outdoor night color
                          pictures is just before it gets completely dark. At
                          this time, some rich blue (or even orange) is in the
                          sky.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This deep color at dusk gives a dramatic background to
                          your pictures. Neon signs, streetlights, and building
                          lights make bright subjects for your pictures. At
                          night, right after it stops raining and everything is
                          still wet, is another good time to take outdoor
                          pictures. The lights in the scene produce many
                          colorful reflections on the wet pavement, adding
                          interest to what may otherwise be a lifeless, dull
                          picture. Many buildings look rather ordinary in
                          daylight, but at night, they are often interestingly
                          lit. Try photographing the hangar at night, with the
                          lights on and the hangar doors open. Also, your ship
                          at night, especially a rainy night may make a very
                          striking picture.

                          Outdoor events that take place at night in a sports
                          stadium are usually well-lighted and make excellent
                          subjects for existing light pictures. Most sports
                          stadiums (as well as streets) are illuminated by
                          mercury-vapor lamps that look blue-green in color when
                          compared to tungsten lamps. Your best color pictures
                          made under mercury-vapor lighting will be shot on
                          daylight color film, although they will appear bluish
                          green because the lights are deficient in red.

                          Some tips for existing light photography are as
                          follows:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            Carry a flashlight so you can see to make camera
                            settings.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            If you do not have an exposure meter or cannot get a
                            good reading, bracket your exposure.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Focus carefully; depth of field is shallow at the
                            wide apertures required for existing light
                            photography.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            When you have a scene illuminated by a combination
                            of light sources, use the type of color film
                            recommended for the predominant light source.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            For pictures of fireworks, support your camera on a
                            tripod, focus at infinity, and aim the camera toward
                            the sky area where the display will take place. Open
                            the shutter for several bursts.
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          To sum it up, light is the single most important
                          element in photography. It is what makes a photograph
                          possible and without it, there would be no image. The
                          quality, quantity, direction, and color of light all
                          play a role in the final outcome of a photograph.
                          Light can create mood and emotion in an image, it can
                          add drama or make a scene seem calm and serene. Some
                          use natural light while others prefer artificial
                          light, but both can be used to great effect. Different
                          lighting techniques can produce vastly different
                          results so it is important for you as a photographer
                          to understand how to use light to their best
                          advantage.<br />

                        <p>
                          The Rule of Thirds is one of the most fundamental
                          guidelines in photography composition. It states that
                          an image should be divided into nine equal parts by
                          two horizontal and two vertical lines, and that the
                          important elements of the scene should be placed along
                          these lines or at the intersections. The theory is
                          that this arrangement is more pleasing to the eye than
                          a centered composition, and it can also help to create
                          a sense of movement or tension. In practice, the Rule
                          of Thirds simply provides a starting point for
                          composing an image. It's up to the photographer to
                          decide whether to follow it strictly or to use it as a
                          tool for creating more interesting and dynamic
                          compositions.

                        <h3 id="golden-ratio">Golden Ratio</h3>
                        <p>
                          The Golden Ratio is a similar but more mathematically
                          complex guideline. It's based on the Fibonacci
                          sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two
                          previous numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc.
                          The Golden Ratio can be expressed as a proportion: 1 :
                          1.618 (or approximately 1 : 1.6). This proportion can
                          be applied to any rectangle, and when doing so, the
                          resulting shape is said to have a "golden" aspect
                          ratio. The Golden Ratio has been used for centuries by
                          artists and architects as a guide for creating
                          harmonious compositions. In recent years, it has also
                          been applied to the field of web design, and it's
                          often used as a starting point for creating responsive
                          layouts.

                        <h3 id="how-to-use-it">How To Use It</h3>
                        <p>
                          When composing a photo using the Rule of Thirds, it's
                          important to keep the horizon line in mind, as this
                          can be used to create a sense of balance. In addition,
                          placing the subject off-center can often lead to a
                          more dynamic and interesting composition. The Rule of
                          Thirds is a classic photography composition technique
                          that involves dividing your frame into thirds, both
                          horizontally and vertically. The idea is to place your
                          subject matter on one of the resulting intersections
                          or along one of the lines. This simple technique can
                          help to create more balance and interest in your
                          photos.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          For beginners, here are a few tips on how to get
                          started with the Rule of Thirds:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            Start by framing your shots using the rule of thirds
                            grid. This will help you to get a feel for where to
                            position your subjects.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Don't be afraid to experiment! The rule of thirds is
                            a guideline, not a hard and fast rule. Sometimes
                            breaking the rules can lead to more interesting
                            compositions.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Remember that the rule of thirds can be applied to
                            more than just the placement of your subject. You
                            can also use it to determine the placement of other
                            elements in the frame, such as horizon lines and
                            leading lines.
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          As it was said the Golden Ratio affects the ratio
                          (1:1.618) of a picture size, as well as the placement
                          of the main subjects in the photo. This ratio is close
                          to the 35mm ratio, so you don't need to change the
                          size of the photo in most cases. But you need to
                          consider the composition: the main subject should lie
                          on one of the four lines or four intersections
                          (subject's eye for example). Truthfully speaking,
                          these rules are not always the same. Rule of Thirds is
                          just a simplified version of the Golden Mean.

                        <p>
                          Another rule is the Golden Triangles. It's more
                          convenient for photos with diagonal lines and is used
                          to create more dynamic and interesting compositions.
                          The golden triangles are two equilateral triangles
                          placed overlapping each other to form a triangle twice
                          as big as the original triangle. The smaller triangle
                          has its vertex at the center of the larger triangle's
                          side, and the other vertices of each triangle are at
                          the midpoints of the sides of the larger triangle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The Golden Triangles can be used for dividing a frame
                          in photography for more pleasurable compositions. This
                          method is also called Fibonacci Triangle Spirals or
                          Fibonacci Rectangles. Dividing a rectangle into a
                          golden triangle creates unique compositions that are
                          very pleasing to look at. The long sides of the golden
                          triangle correspond to the long sides of the frame,
                          while the short side corresponds to the short side of
                          the frame. This results in a unique aspect ratio that
                          is different from traditional rectangles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Such a method can be used for any type of photography,
                          from portraits to landscapes and even for
                          cinematography and video editing. You may start by
                          framing your shots using the golden triangles grid.
                          This will help you to get a feel for where to position
                          your subjects.

                          Golden Spiral or Golden Rectangle
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          And one more rule is a Golden Spiral or Golden
                          Rectangle (you'll see why it's a rectangle in the
                          tools section). The Golden Spiral is a fascinating
                          mathematical concept with far-reaching implications.
                          Also known as the Fibonacci Sequence, this pattern can
                          be found in nature, art, and even music. But what
                          exactly is the Golden Spiral? And why is it so
                          important? Well, it turns out that this sequence can
                          be used to create a never-ending spiral. If we plot
                          these numbers on a graph and connect them with
                          straight lines, we begin to see a spiral shape emerge.
                          This spiral gets wider and wider as it goes around in
                          a circle, but it never crosses over itself or reaches
                          an end. In other words, it's infinite!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          But that's not all. The Golden Spiral also appears in
                          nature. For example, many sea creatures have shells
                          that follow this pattern. The florets of a sunflower
                          are arranged in a Golden Spiral. Even our own DNA
                          molecule has a double helix shape that resembles a
                          Golden Spiral! Clearly, the Golden Spiral is a
                          fascinating concept with wide-ranging implications.
                          It's no wonder that this unique pattern has captivated
                          the imaginations of mathematicians and scientists for
                          centuries. Who knows what else we may discover about
                          this intriguing shape in the future?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          There should be something, leading the eye to the
                          center of the composition. It could be a line or
                          several subjects. This "something" could just be there
                          without leading the eyes, but it will fulfill its
                          purpose anyway. The most important thing is that all
                          these rules should serve you as an inspiration and
                          help you to make more interesting compositions, but
                          not to restrict your creativity
                        </p>
                        <p>in any way.</p>
